## PCA
pyPCA.py contains three methods, based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA), to compute spatial and temporal, or spatio-temporal patterns of variability in a given geospatial time series data set. The three methods include:

`Empirical Orthogonal Function Analysis (EOFA)`\
`Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA)`\
`Nonlinear Laplacian Spectral Analysis (NLSA)`

The code was built based around the theory outlined in sections 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4 respectively of [Bushuk 2015](https://search.proquest.com/docview/1711150581?pq-origsite=gscholar&fromopenview=true).

See examples of each of these methods in the accompanying Jupyter Notebook. In order to use each of these methods the following Python packages are required:

`NumPy`\
`SciPy`
